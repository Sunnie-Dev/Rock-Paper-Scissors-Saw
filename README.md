# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Saw
Software Engineering Specification and Code Implementation Of Rock Paper Scissors Saw

**1. Introduction**
This project requires students to create a design for a “Rock, Paper, Scissors, and Saw” game and then implement it in Java. This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document will outline all the features required of the system. 

**1.1 Purpose**
The purpose of this simple SRS is to provide all the basic requirements necessary to complete Software Design Specification (SDS) for Project 4 and to implement the system.

**1.2 Scope**
The software to be created will be a stand-alone PC representation of the hand game called “Rock, Paper, Scissors, and Saw”, implemented with OO approach using Java. It will have two human players and a computer acting as the third player. 

**2. General Description**
When user(s) starts the program, he will be prompted for the names of the two human players. These values will be used for all prompts and statistics in the program.

**Menu**
Then there will be a menu with the following selections: 
  “1. Play game”, 
  “2. Show game rules”, 
  “3. Show statistics”, 
  “4. Exit” in that order. 
  
  Rules selection  will provide rules of the game.
  Statistics will show the accumulative wins, loses, and ties per each player (both rounds and games),
  Exit will close the program.
  
**Game Play**
When play game is selected, each player will be able to select his weapon (rock, paper, scissors, or saw) and computer will make its choice.

Each of the players will be playing against the computer. A game will consist of 3 rounds. 

After each round either a player or computer will be the winner of the round and after 3 rounds, again either computer or player will be the winner of the game.

User(s) will be able to run multiple games and their wins/loses/ties will be displayed in the statistics option along with the overall human winner.
